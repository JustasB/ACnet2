** This file depends on functions and constants defined in defaults.g
** As it is also intended as an example of the use of the tabchannel
** object to implement concentration dependent channels, it has extensive
** comments.  Note that the original units used in the paper have been
** converted to SI (MKS) units.  Also, we define the ionic equilibrium 
** potentials relative to the resting potential, EREST_ACT.  In the
** paper, this was defined to be zero.  Here, we use -0.060 volts, the
** measured value relative to the outside of the cell.

/* November 1999 update for GENESIS 2.2: Previous versions of this file used
   a combination of a table, tabgate, and vdep_channel to implement the
   Ca-dependent K Channel - K(C).  This new version uses the new tabchannel
   "instant" field, introduced in GENESIS 2.2, to implement an
   "instantaneous" gate for the multiplicative Ca-dependent factor in the
   conductance.   This allows these channels to be used with the fast
   hsolve chanmodes > 1.

// CONSTANTS
float EREST_ACT = -0.060 /* hippocampal cell resting potl */
float ENA = 0.115 + EREST_ACT // 0.055
float EK = -0.015 + EREST_ACT // -0.075

For these channels, the maximum channel conductance (Gbar) has been
calculated using the CA3 soma channel conductance densities and soma
area.  Typically, the functions which create these channels will be used
to create a library of prototype channels.  When the cell reader creates
copies of these channels in various compartments, it will set the actual
value of Gbar by calculating it from the cell parameter file.

/****************************************************************************
Next, we need an element to take the Calcium current calculated by the Ca
channel and convert it to the Ca concentration.  The "Ca_concen" object
solves the equation dC/dt = B*I_Ca - C/tau, and sets Ca = Ca_base + C.  As
it is easy to make mistakes in units when using this Calcium diffusion
equation, the units used here merit some discussion.

With Ca_base = 0, this corresponds to Traub's diffusion equation for
concentration, except that the sign of the current term here is positive, as
GENESIS uses the convention that I_Ca is the current flowing INTO the
compartment through the channel.  In SI units, the concentration is usually
expressed in moles/m^3 (which equals millimoles/liter), and the units of B
are chosen so that B = 1/(ion_charge * Faraday * volume). Current is
expressed in amperes and one Faraday = 96487 coulombs.  However, in this
case, Traub expresses the concentration in arbitrary units, current in
microamps and uses tau = 13.33 msec.  If we use the same concentration units,
but express current in amperes and tau in seconds, our B constant is then
10^12 times the constant (called "phi") used in the paper.  The actual value
used will be typically be determined by the cell reader from the cell
parameter file.  However, for the prototype channel we wlll use Traub's
corrected value for the soma.  (An error in the paper gives it as 17,402
rather than 17.402.)  In our units, this will be 17.402e12.

/*
This Ca_concen element should receive an "I_Ca" message from the calcium
channel, accompanied by the value of the calcium channel current.  As we
will ordinarily use the cell reader to create copies of these prototype
elements in one or more compartments, we need some way to be sure that the
needed messages are established.  Although the cell reader has enough
information to create the messages which link compartments to their channels
and to other adjacent compartments, it most be provided with the information
needed to establish additional messages.  This is done by placing the
message string in a user-defined field of one of the elements which is
involved in the message.  The cell reader recognizes the added field names
"addmsg1", "addmsg2", etc. as indicating that they are to be
evaluated and used to set up messages.  The paths are relative to the
element which contains the message string in its added field.  Thus,
"../Ca_hip_traub91" refers to the sibling element Ca_hip_traub91 and "."
refers to the Ca_hip_conc element itself.
