   I've added an optional chanpath arg to the make_xxx_traub91 functions
   to allow renaming them.  But, if the Ca-dependent channels are to
   work properly, the Ca_concen element must be named "Ca_conc" and
   the Ca channel must be named Ca_hip_traub91

/* FILE INFORMATION
** The 1991 Traub set of voltage and concentration dependent channels
** Implemented as tabchannels by : Dave Beeman
**      R.D.Traub, R. K. S. Wong, R. Miles, and H. Michelson
**	Journal of Neurophysiology, Vol. 66, p. 635 (1991)
**
** This file depends on functions and constants defined in defaults.g
** As it is also intended as an example of the use of the tabchannel
** object to implement concentration dependent channels, it has extensive
** comments.  Note that the original units used in the paper have been
** converted to SI (MKS) units.  Also, we define the ionic equilibrium 
** potentials relative to the resting potential, EREST_ACT.  In the
** paper, this was defined to be zero.  Here, we use -0.060 volts, the
** measured value relative to the outside of the cell.

/* November 1999 update for GENESIS 2.2: Previous versions of this file used
   a combination of a table, tabgate, and vdep_channel to implement the
   Ca-dependent K Channel - K(C).  This new version uses the new tabchannel
   "instant" field, introduced in GENESIS 2.2, to implement an
   "instantaneous" gate for the multiplicative Ca-dependent factor in the
   conductance.   This allows these channels to be used with the fast
   hsolve chanmodes > 1.
*/

// CONSTANTS
float EREST_ACT = -0.060 /* hippocampal cell resting potl */
float ENA = 0.115 + EREST_ACT // 0.055
float EK = -0.015 + EREST_ACT // -0.075
float ECA = 0.140 + EREST_ACT // 0.080
float SOMA_A = 3.320e-9       // soma area m^2 - usually will be changed

/*
For these channels, the maximum channel conductance (Gbar) has been
calculated using the CA3 soma channel conductance densities and soma
area.  Typically, the functions which create these channels will be used
to create a library of prototype channels.  When the cell reader creates
copies of these channels in various compartments, it will set the actual
value of Gbar by calculating it from the cell parameter file.

/* This is a tabchannel which gets the calcium concentration from Ca_hip_conc
   in order to calculate the activation of its Z gate.  It is set up much
   like the Ca channel, except that the A and B tables have values which are
   functions of concentration, instead of voltage.
